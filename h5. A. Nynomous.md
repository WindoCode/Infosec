## Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

### 1. Tor Still Works:

- Tor remains effective in providing anonymity, as confirmed by NSA leaks.
- NSA acknowledges challenges in completely circumventing Tor's anonymity.
- Compromising Tor users typically involves exploiting browser or user misconfigurations.

### 2. Tor is Not Only Used by Criminals:

- Tor serves various legitimate purposes, including activism, secure communications, family privacy, and journalism.
- Criminals have access to more effective tools than Tor for illegal activities.

### 3. Tor Does Not Have a Military Backdoor:

- Initial development funded by US Navy, but no backdoor exists in Tor.
- Audited by security experts, open-source nature allows code verification.

### 4. No US Prosecutions for Running a Tor Relay:

- No known US cases of prosecution for running a Tor relay.
- Running a relay is not believed to be illegal under US law.

### 5. Tor is Easy to Use:

- Tor Browser Bundle provides a user-friendly, pre-configured Tor browser.
- Tails is a user-friendly live operating system with Tor integration.
### 6. Tor is Not as Slow as You Think:

- Tor network speed has improved over time.
- More relays contribute to a faster Tor network.

### 7. Tor is Not Foolproof:

- Proper usage with Tor Browser Bundle or Tails is crucial for maintaining anonymity.
- Logging into services like Google and Facebook over Tor may compromise privacy within those systems.
- Adversaries with access to both sides of the connection may perform statistical analysis.


## Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser â‚¬; subchapters: "Introduction", "History and Intended Use of The Onion Router", "How The Onion Router Works", "Tracking Criminals Using TOR".

### Introduction
- The book, "Hiding Behind the Keyboard," aims to guide investigators in identifying covert communications and the individuals behind them.
- It focuses on forensic analysis and traditional investigative methods to uncover hidden communications.
- The book is not a guide on illegal activities but rather a resource for understanding and analyzing covert communications for investigative purposes.
- It complements a previously published book, "Placing the Suspect Behind the Keyboard," by delving deeper into technical aspects and forensic analysis.

### History and intended use of TOR

- Tor, or The Onion Router, was created to enable unrestricted and anonymous internet communication. It allows users to bypass government censorship, access blocked websites, and facilitate secure communication for various purposes, including whistleblowing and private business conversations. 
- Despite its origins in the US government, Tor is now a decentralized network open for improvements by anyone with technical expertise.

### How The Onion Router Works

- Tor functions by directing a user's internet traffic through random relays on the internet, encrypting the data in layers using unbreakable elliptic curve cryptography. 
- As the encrypted data passes through each relay (entry, middle, and exit), a layer of encryption is stripped off. The exit relay, which connects to the user's desired target, does not have knowledge of the entire traffic route. 
- Additionally, Tor dynamically changes the relays used every 10 minutes, making it exceedingly difficult to track the traffic.

### Tracking Criminals Using TOR

Tracking Tor users poses a significant challenge, and government agencies worldwide are actively working to deanonymize Tor users for law enforcement and national security purposes. While a few successful cases have made headlines, these were primarily due to suspects' errors rather than a direct breach of Tor's security.

- One notable instance involved the FBI exploiting a Firefox bug to capture the IP addresses of users accessing a child pornography hosting service. This exploit, however, was specific to outdated versions of Tor. 
- The primary weakness of Tor lies in user behavior. Customizing the browser, particularly allowing certain scripts and plugins, can inadvertently leak information, such as geolocation. 
- Researchers have explored various methods to deanonymize Tor, including attacking the network itself, but these require significant resources and time.
  
a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

search engine for onion sites
marketplace
forum
a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

c) Voluntary or alternative task: You can do this task in place of a and b. Install a darknet browser other than TOR, such as I2P or Freenet. Search, screenshot and describe examples of contents there.
