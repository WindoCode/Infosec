decypter message:

First I saw patterns ”DHHP//”, which showed like a link. ”OWG” would standout as COM, as common domain. I saw KWU standout a lot. I would assume this is some common word, like you! As E is the most common letter in english, I gave E = I.

On second part I counted the top 5 most frequent numbers. I 12 times, B 12 times, M 10 times, T 10 times, AKOWY 8 times. I added above letters to my decypher alpabet, and started cracking the riddle. As I was solving the riddle, some words missed a letter or two, which were guessable by solving the previous words. Filled up the decypher alphabet and got the answer.

THATS’IT YOU’RE NOW OFFICIALLY A CODEBREAKER. AS YOU MAY SEE SIMPLE SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS CAN BE BROKEN WITH FREQUENCY ANALYSIS SE YOU AR http://TEROKARVINEN.COM.
